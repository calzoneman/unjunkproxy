# unjunkproxy

HTTP proxy for certain media hosts for my own personal use.

I strongly believe that images and videos ought to be served to my browser as
images and videos, not as some crappy HTML that doesn't load without JavaScript,
and not as attachments (I will save it if I want to, thanks).

Thus I detour my URL opener for my chat client through a proxy that rewrites
common offenders such as Discord, Reddit, and Imgur.
